# Cascade Circuit
A python code in development to analyze a component list of real and imaginary impedances, process the ABCD matrix, and output the relevant measurements for a frequency sweep. 

## Completed
- imports
- seperating and cleaning inport file
- extracting source data
- frequency sweep
- ordering components for matrix calculation
- matrix multiplication for shunt or series components

## To Do
- compare output methods
- sweep for impedances for each component with imaginary values(R,G,C,L)
- finish functions for output calculations
- output correct values with the desired formatting
--> read which values are required from initial input file
